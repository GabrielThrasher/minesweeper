A recreation of the classic game Minesweeper -- can you win?

Notes: Mines are generated after the player's first left-click on a tile to avoid them unluckily (as they have no information from the board) clicking on a tile mine and losing already. Thus, the debug button will only display a message, not mines, before the player's first left-click. Also, in the welcome menu, the cursor can be moved using the left and right keys. At any cursor position, the player can use the delete and backspace keys (they function as they normally would in an outside program) or can insert an alpha char in place.
