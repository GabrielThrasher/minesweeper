8 Other notes: Mines are generated after the player's first left-click
               on a tile to avoid them unluckily (as they have no information 
               from the board) clicking on a tile mine and losing already. 
               Thus, the debug button will only display a message, not mines,
               before the player's first left-click. Also, in the welcome
               menu, the cursor can be moved using the left and right
               keys. At any cursor position, the player can use the delete
               and backspace keys (they function as they normally would in
               an outside program) or can insert an alpha char in place.
